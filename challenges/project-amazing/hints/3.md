You can run arbitrary JavaScript as an admin user thanks to an XSS
vulnerability. 

Here's one strategy for beating this challenge:

1. Set up a request bin at http://requestb.in/
2. Create a user with a name of a JavaScript payload that adds an image tag to
   the page with the `src` attribute set to your request bin URL with a query
   string of `"?secret=" + $('.secret').text()`;
3. Wait for the admin user to log in.
4. The user logging in and running the code should result in a request to your
   request bin. The request bin will display the data in the query string,
   including the value for the secret that you set.
5. Parse the secret out of the request bin inspect page for your bin URL.
