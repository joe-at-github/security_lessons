The API authentication code checks that a value for `authentication_token` has
been provided but doesn't care what the value is.

This means you can access all of the user data by visiting:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/users.json?authentication_token=whateveryoulike
```

And then read the secret out of the response body JSON.
